# switch

This scripts helps you run mosquitto mqqt broker or thingsboard service locally without getting errors as both service utilizes same mqqt port and you'll have to stop one befor using the other


since you're here i assume that you are tired of compiling your codes with up to three lines of command before seeing an error or testing your program

This is a custom script that helps automate that boring process of hitting your keyboard over and over again to do the same task and thus saves time.

And guess what !!!

- you can invoke this script from any directory you're working on
